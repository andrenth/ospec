1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

OSpec is a Behavior-Driven Development library for OCaml, inspired by RSpec, a
Ruby BDD library. It is implemented as a Camlp4 syntax extension.

This is a work in progress and should be considered less-than-alpha quality.


2. USAGE
--------

To build OSpec, simply type "make". This will build an executable called
"ospec", which takes specification files as command line arguments.  For
example, the command below will run the specifications in the file specs.ml:

  $ ./ospec specs.ml


3. SYNTAX
---------

Specifications are defined with the "describe" keyword. Inside a specification,
example groups are defined, with the "it" keyword, including one or more
expectations.

A useless example to show OSpec's syntax:

  describe "The number one" do
    it "should equal 2 when added to itself" do
      (1 + 1) should = 2  (* anything 'a -> 'a -> bool should work *)
    done;

    it "should be positive" do
      let positive x = x > 0 in
      1 should be positive  (* 'a -> bool should work too *)
    done;

    it "should be negative when multiplied by -1" do
      let x = 1 * (-1) in
      x should be < 0;      (* "be" is optional *)
      x should not be >= 0
    done;

    it "should fail when divided by 0" do
      (* For exception tests, wrap it in a fun *)
      let f = fun () -> 1 / 0 in
      f should raise_an_exception;
      f should raise_exception Division_by_zero;
      f should not raise Exit
    done;

    it "should match ^[0-9]+$ when converted to a string" do
      (string_of_int 1) should match_regexp "^[0-9]+$"
    done
  done


4. HELPERS
----------

Some helper functions are provided, as shown above. They are described below.

val raise_an_exception : (unit -> 'a) -> bool
  Returns true if any exception is raised

val raise_exception : (unit -> 'a) -> exn -> bool
  Returns true if the given exception is raised

val match_regexp : string -> string -> bool
  Returns true if the given string (first argument) matches the given regex
  (second argument).


5. TODO
-------

* When an expectation fails, print the operation and expected/actual values.
* Handle errors in the specs gracefully.
* Provide "before" and "after" keywords for setup/teardown code.
* Allow nested specs.
* Provide different report formats.
* Provide more helpers.
* Cleanup the code, which is horrible and hacky.
* ...
